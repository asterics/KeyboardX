Contains the [XML Schema for keyboards]
(https://github.com/s3huber/KeyboardX/tree/master/Keyboards/schema), 
[test](https://github.com/s3huber/KeyboardX/tree/master/Keyboards/test) and 
[demo](https://github.com/s3huber/KeyboardX/tree/master/Keyboards/showroom) keyboards and some 
[scripts](https://github.com/s3huber/KeyboardX/tree/master/Keyboards/bin). 

## showroom

Contains keyboards for demonstrating the player.

## test

Contains (simple) keyboards for testing single features. The naming of a keyboard file already 
suggests it's coarse purpose. Further there is usually a small description in form of a comment 
contained in the file.
